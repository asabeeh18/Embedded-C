use back wala left while fixing
left motor PROBABLY faulty (or that maybe becaz of less charging)
possible algos

for left or rigth black 
	simple move left or right //for some reason it doesnt work
	
for all white
		at lower velocity
	parse right  little 
	OR then 
		left 
			while any is black
				then give to fix
				--x-faults...angular boosters which makes bot waay off track
for all black
	node detected
for 2 black
	move little towards little black indicaotr
		if all black 
			node found
		else move
		
		
solutions
angular boosters whicih makes bot waay off track
	before coming to real velocity 
		fix till black>40 and left & right<40
		

for all white
		at lower velocity
	parse right  little 
	OR then 
		left 
		
	use variables,delays,angular shift(>.<)
		
	if one side fails do the other side for the same amount
		keep increasing search radius in small increments
